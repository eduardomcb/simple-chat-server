# WebSocket Server in Node.js

This is a Node.js WebSocket server project that provides real-time communication support for the Kotlin multi-platform chat application. The server uses the `ws` package to establish a WebSocket connection.

## Features

- Real-time communication using the WebSocket protocol.
- Integration with the Kotlin multi-platform chat application.
- Easy configuration and customization to suit your project's needs.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
